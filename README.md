# bundesliga_scraper

I am trying to scrap data from the Bundesliga website using python with selenium and pandas.

For more information about how to install selenium and the Google Chrome driver, read this -> https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html

What script is already doing:
- Read a specific URL and scrap data from the first ~200 players
- Tested only for the "distance" stats

What needs to be configured:
- URL at the top of the script
- CSV file name at the bottom

What *really* needs to be improved:
- Clicking in the "Load more button"
